# analog-synthesizer
Analog synthesizer for an octave (8 notes).

This project was made based on JT Makes It's "Awesome Analog Synthesizer/Organ Using Only Discrete Components". The original project can be found [here](https://www.instructables.com/Make-an-Awesome-Analog-Synthesizer/).

I recreated the original author's schematic on Altium Designer, and used it to create a custom PCB. The schematic and footprint files are as follow:

There's also a [demo](https://youtube.com/shorts/dsNalL1WHec) of the synthesizer at work.
